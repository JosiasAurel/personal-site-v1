In this post i am going to show you how to create a react app without Create-React-App CLI.

First of all, you need to creata a folder to contain your project.

```shell
mkdir my-react-app
```

Then you will have to enter that folder and initialize a new node project.

```shell
npm init -y #skip the questions
```

After creating the project, you will need to install _parcel_, _react_ and _react-dom_ dependencies.

```shell
npm install parcel-bundler react react-dom
```

This will install parcel (which is a simpler alternative to webpack) along with react and react-dom.

Now that you have the dependencies installed, create an HTML file which will serve as your template.
Let's call it _index.html_

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

    <title>HTML</title>

    <!-- HTML -->

    <!-- Custom Styles -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now we need to create our _main.js_ file.
Add the following code in the main.js file.

```javascript
// import dependencies

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

// A simple react component
const Hello = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h1> Hello World </h1>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<Hello />, document.getElementById("root")); // render element on div with ID of 'root'
```

Now we have a basic react component that shows _Hello World_ to the DOM.
We need to compile it to actually see the result.
You need to run

```shell
parcel index.html #or whatever name you gave to your html file
```

Parcel will take care of the rest, that is : compiling your JSX component to html and bundling it. It will then startup a local server you can visit to view your app. It will automatically reload when any change is made.
This is the end. Now you can create a react app withiut the default CLI.
You can run the below command to actually build your react app for production

```shell
parcel build index.html
```

Note that you can write your react components in separate files just like you will do with create-react-app project.
